JavaScript Object Notation - it's using javascript to pass information around. It uses basic JS objects and arrays to store data. 

EXAMPLE OF JSON FORMATED AN OBJECT:
[
{
  "name" : "Dom";
  "phone" : "796-592-212"
}, 
{
  "name" : "Dom";
  "inoffice" : true
}
]


Notice lack of comma at the last value. 


                                                      Requirement for JSON formatted data.
                                                      
First, in regular JavaScript objects keys don't have to be quoted.
However, valid JSON requires not only quotes around the
property name, but they must also be double quotes.
Single quotes won't work. Strings also require double quotes.



JSON is picky. To check if the JSON data is correctly formatted I can use.

Placing the JS at the end allows the page to fully load before the JavaScript is loaded. This will often speed up the page load, 
as it isn't waiting for the JavaScript to load before finishing the HTML rendering.
However, if elements on the page are reliant explicitly on JavaScript, as it is here, 
the JavaScript will need to load completely before the page loads, or the page will not function properly. 
In case of AJAX, you're using JavaScript to retrieve data from the server to render on the page, 
but if the JavaScript is run after the page loads, then the page doesn't have any data it needs to render, 
so your data will not show on the page.
