JavaScript Object Notation - it's using javascript to pass information around. It uses basic JS objects and arrays to store data. 

EXAMPLE OF JSON FORMATED AN OBJECT:

{
  "name" : "Dom";
  "phone" : "796-592-212"
}

Notice lack of comma at the last value. 


                                                      Requirement for JSON formatted data.
                                                      
First, in regular JavaScript objects keys don't have to be quoted.
However, valid JSON requires not only quotes around the
property name, but they must also be double quotes.
Single quotes won't work. Strings also require double quotes.
